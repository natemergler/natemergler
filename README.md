## [Spotify Journey Jams]()
2023 Hackathon Project
Create the perfect length playlist for your drive.

Originally created by me and some friends for VT Hacks, I continued development until [Spotify changed their API access](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api) and broke it.
While the original repository has been lost in time, I have linked the latest iteration as well as a write up.
### TLDR:
Spotify Journey Jams began as a python script using the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com). The user would enter their current location, their destination, and an artist. From there, our "sophiticated algorithms" would find similar artists and compile a playlist within 2 minutes of the driving time. After the hackathon finished, I began to refactor the project to JS to provide web access. The original design was created by Mikako and the Mapbox API integration was implemented by Connor.
